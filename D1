Here's the shell script code you can insert in your SSM Automation document (JSON format) under the aws:runShellScript action to fetch the Instance ID securely using IMDSv2 and append it along with CloudWatch status to a text file (like /tmp/status.txt):

Shell Script Block for SSM JSON Document:

{
  "action": "aws:runShellScript",
  "name": "FetchInstanceIdAndStatus",
  "inputs": {
    "runCommand": [
      "TOKEN=$(curl -s -X PUT \"http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token\" -H \"X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600\")",
      "INSTANCE_ID=$(curl -s -H \"X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN\" http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id)",
      "CLOUDWATCH_STATUS=$(echo -n \"LinuxInstalled\")",  # Replace with dynamic status if needed
      "echo \"$INSTANCE_ID $CLOUDWATCH_STATUS\" >> /tmp/status.txt"
    ]
  }
}

Notes:

This uses IMDSv2 to avoid 401 errors.

You can replace "LinuxInstalled" with the actual variable capturing CloudWatch status earlier in your script.

You can modify the output format (comma-separated, etc.) as needed for CSV.


Let me know if you want to send this file to S3 or append it to another central file.
