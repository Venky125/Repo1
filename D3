Hereâ€™s how to insert the shell script (for copying /tmp/status.txt to status.csv in S3) into your SSM document JSON under the mainSteps section, assuming this is a AWS-RunShellScript document for Linux instances.

Sample SSM JSON Snippet

{
  "schemaVersion": "2.2",
  "description": "Copy /tmp/status.txt to S3 as status.csv",
  "mainSteps": [
    {
      "action": "aws:runShellScript",
      "name": "CopyStatusToS3",
      "inputs": {
        "runCommand": [
          "#!/bin/bash",
          "BUCKET_NAME=\"your-bucket-name\"",
          "SRC_FILE=\"/tmp/status.txt\"",
          "DEST_FILE=\"status.csv\"",
          "aws s3 cp \"$SRC_FILE\" \"s3://$BUCKET_NAME/$DEST_FILE\""
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}

Replace:

"your-bucket-name" with the actual S3 bucket name.


Notes:

This overwrites status.csv in the bucket each time.

Make sure the EC2 instance has the appropriate IAM role with S3 PutObject permission.

Ensure awscli is installed and the system has access to the S3 endpoint
