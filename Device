To get the device name of each EC2 instance, you can query the EC2 instances using the aws_instance data source and then access the block_device_mappings attribute, which will give you the device names for the attached volumes. Here's an example Terraform code to achieve this:

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"  # Replace with your desired region
}

data "aws_instances" "all" {}

output "instance_device_names" {
  value = [
    for instance in data.aws_instances.all.ids : {
      instance_id = instance
      device_names = [
        for device in data.aws_instance.all[instance].block_device_mappings : device.device_name
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Explanation:

data "aws_instances" "all" fetches all EC2 instances in the specified region.

The block_device_mappings attribute on each EC2 instance contains the device names for the instance's attached volumes.

The output block will list the device_name for each volume attached to each EC2 instance.


Important Notes:

1. block_device_mappings: This will return a list of block devices attached to the instance, and each block device will have a device_name property (like /dev/sda1 or /dev/xvda).


2. Terraform Versions: Ensure you're using the correct syntax based on your Terraform version. This example assumes the use of Terraform 0.12+ for complex expressions.



This will return a list of device names for each EC2 instance, which you can use in further Terraform resources or outputs.
