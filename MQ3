Thank you — that’s a key observation. Here's exactly what's going wrong:

🔍 Problem Analysis

1. Only the first file is printing "File: ..."

Because getline reads from the same awk input stream, once we manually getline, it consumes the next line, and awk proceeds to the line after that — so one file might eat through the rest.



2. Printing all lines after AMQ9456I instead of just one

Because getline pulls one extra line into the awk engine, and then awk continues with the following one as normal — you effectively move ahead by 2 lines, but only saved one.

✅ Corrected & Reliable Script

This version:

Does not use getline (to avoid breaking the input stream).

Stores all lines first.

Then processes them in the END block for full control.

#!/bin/bash

# Output log file
output_log="/tmp/amq9456_today_only.log"
: > "$output_log"  # Clear previous content

# Get today's date in MM/DD/YYYY format
today=$(date +"%m/%d/%Y")

# Process each log file
for file in /MQ/*/data/qmgrs/*/errors/AMQERR01.LOG; do
    awk -v t1="$today" -v fname="$file" '
    {
        lines[NR] = $0
        max = NR
    }

    END {
        for (i = 9; i <= max; i++) {
            if (lines[i] ~ /AMQ9456I/) {
                date_line = lines[i - 8]
                if (date_line ~ t1) {
                    print "File: " fname
                    for (j = i - 8; j <= i + 1; j++) {
                        if (j in lines) print lines[j]
                    }
                    print "----"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ' "$file"
done >> "$output_log"

✅ What It Does Now:

Reads and stores all lines first.

In END, it:

Checks each line for AMQ9456I

If line i-8 (8 above) matches today’s date → it's a valid match.

Then prints lines from i-8 to i+1 (8 before, the match, and one after).


Appends all valid results to /tmp/amq9456_today_only.log

Let me know if you'd like:

To support rotated logs like AMQERR01.LOG.1

To extract only the matching text (more concise logs)

To support matching by date range instead of only today
