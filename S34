Creating and Deleting Directories in an S3 Bucket using AWS CLI

S3 does not have a traditional directory structure like a filesystem. Instead, it uses a key-based structure, where "folders" are just prefixes in object keys.

Step 1: Create a "Directory" (Prefix) in S3

Since S3 doesnâ€™t support empty directories, you can simulate a directory by adding a file inside it.

Using AWS CLI

aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://my-demo-bucket-123/my-folder/

This will create a virtual directory called my-folder/ inside my-demo-bucket-123.

To explicitly create an empty directory, you can use a placeholder file:

aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://my-demo-bucket-123/my-folder/dummy.txt


---

Step 2: List "Directories" in S3

To verify the created directory:

aws s3 ls s3://my-demo-bucket-123/

or

aws s3 ls s3://my-demo-bucket-123/my-folder/


---

Step 3: Delete a "Directory" in S3

Since S3 doesn't store empty directories, you must delete all files inside a folder to remove it.

Using AWS CLI

aws s3 rm s3://my-demo-bucket-123/my-folder/ --recursive

This will remove all objects under my-folder/, effectively deleting the folder.
