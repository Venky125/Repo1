To ensure that your Amazon S3 buckets enforce encryption of data using SSL, follow these steps:


---

1. Check Bucket Policy for SSL Enforcement

To ensure all requests use HTTPS, check and update the S3 bucket policy:

1. Open AWS S3 Console → Select your bucket.


2. Go to the Permissions tab → Scroll to Bucket policy.


3. Look for the following policy statement (or add it if missing):

{
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name", "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"],
  "Condition": {
    "Bool": {
      "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
    }
  }
}


4. This denies all requests that are not using HTTPS (SSL/TLS encryption).


5. Click Save changes.

2. Enable Default Encryption on S3 Bucket

To ensure objects are always encrypted at rest:

1. Open S3 Console → Select your bucket.


2. Go to the Properties tab.


3. Scroll down to Default encryption.


4. Enable encryption and choose:

SSE-S3 (Amazon S3-managed keys)

SSE-KMS (AWS Key Management Service)

SSE-C (Customer-provided keys)



5. Click Save changes.

3. Verify Bucket Encryption via AWS CLI

Run the following AWS CLI commands to check the bucket's encryption settings:

aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket your-bucket-name

If encryption is enabled, the response should show encryption settings:

{
    "ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration": {
        "Rules": [
            {
                "ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
                    "SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}


---

4. Check Bucket Policy Enforcement via AWS CLI

Run the following command to check if HTTPS enforcement exists:

aws s3api get-bucket-policy --bucket your-bucket-name

If SSL enforcement is configured correctly, you should see "aws:SecureTransport": "false" in the response.


---

5. Set IAM Policy to Require Encryption (Optional)

You can enforce encryption for all users using an IAM policy:

{
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Action": "s3:PutObject",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*",
  "Condition": {
    "StringNotEquals": {
      "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"
    }
  }
}

Attach this policy to IAM roles or users to enforce encryption at object upload level.


---

Conclusion

By implementing these steps, you ensure:

All data is encrypted at rest (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C).

All data transfers use SSL (HTTPS) via bucket policies.

Uploads must be encrypted using IAM policies.
