You're rightâ€”incorrect path validation might be causing the issue. Let's ensure that the PowerShell path validation correctly identifies the CloudWatch Agent on Windows.

Windows Path Validation Fix

In Windows PowerShell:

Test-Path is used to check if a file or folder exists.

Paths with spaces (C:\Program Files\...) must be enclosed in double quotes (").

The CloudWatch Agent path and configuration file path should be explicitly validated.

Fixed PowerShell Commands for Windows SSM Document

Checking Installation:

Instead of:

$cwAgentPath = 'C:\\Program Files\\Amazon\\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\\amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl.ps1'

Use:

$cwAgentPath = "C:\Program Files\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl"

(.ps1 was incorrectly assumed; it's just amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl.)

To validate:

if (Test-Path "$cwAgentPath") {
    Write-Output 'CloudWatch Agent is installed';
} else {
    Write-Output 'CloudWatch Agent is not installed';
}

Checking Configuration:

Instead of:

$configPath = 'C:\\ProgramData\\Amazon\\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\\amazon-cloudwatch-agent.toml'

Use:

$configPath = "C:\ProgramData\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\amazon-cloudwatch-agent.toml"

To validate:

if (Test-Path "$configPath") {
    Write-Output 'CloudWatch Agent is configured';
} else {
    Write-Output 'CloudWatch Agent is not configured';
}

Updated Windows Section for SSM Document

Replace the Windows step in your SSM document with this:

{
  "action": "aws:runPowerShellScript",
  "name": "CheckCloudWatchWindows",
  "precondition": {
    "StringEquals": ["platformType", "Windows"]
  },
  "inputs": {
    "runCommand": [
      "$cwAgentPath = \"C:\\Program Files\\Amazon\\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\\amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl\"",
      "$configPath = \"C:\\ProgramData\\Amazon\\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\\amazon-cloudwatch-agent.toml\"",
      "if (Test-Path \"$cwAgentPath\") {",
      "  Write-Output 'CloudWatch Agent is installed';",
      "  if (Test-Path \"$configPath\") {",
      "    Write-Output 'CloudWatch Agent is configured';",
      "  } else {",
      "    Write-Output 'CloudWatch Agent is not configured';",
      "  }",
      "} else {",
      "  Write-Output 'CloudWatch Agent is not installed';",
      "}"
    ]
  }
}

Why This Fix Works

1. Uses correct paths without .ps1 (as amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl does not have .ps1).


2. Uses double quotes (") to handle spaces in paths.


3. Ensures explicit file validation.



Try running this updated version and let me know if it works as expected!
