✅ Why This Works Correctly Now

✔ Fixes Windows path validation:

No .ps1 extension assumed.

Uses "C:\Program Files\..." properly with Test-Path.


✔ Fixes Linux validation:

Uses [ -f "file" ] to correctly check for files.


✔ Handles both Installation & Configuration Checks separately.

This should now work correctly on both Linux and Windows EC2 instances. Let me know if you face any issues!
