Got it — you want JSON, because your main document is in JSON format.

Here’s how you can capture output in JSON, and use it later in the same document:


---

JSON Example:

1. Step to capture output from Check_CloudWatch_Status_Custom_V2

{
  "name": "Check_CloudWatch_Status_Custom_V2",
  "action": "aws:runCommand",
  "inputs": {
    "DocumentName": "Check_CloudWatch_Status_Custom_V2",
    "InstanceIds": [
      "{{ instanceid }}"
    ]
  },
  "outputs": [
    {
      "Name": "CloudWatchStatusOutput",
      "Selector": "$.StandardOutputContent",
      "Type": "String"
    }
  ]
}


---

2. Step to use the captured output

{
  "name": "PrintOutput",
  "action": "aws:runShellScript",
  "inputs": {
    "runCommand": [
      "echo \"CloudWatch status is {{ Check_CloudWatch_Status_Custom_V2.CloudWatchStatusOutput }}\""
    ]
  }
}

How to Insert in Main Document:

In your main document JSON (mainDoc.json), under "mainSteps": [ ... ]

First paste the capture step (Check_CloudWatch_Status_Custom_V2).

Then later paste the usage step (PrintOutput).


Example inside your document:

{
  "schemaVersion": "2.2",
  "description": "My Main Document",
  "parameters": {
    ...
  },
  "mainSteps": [
    {
      "name": "Check_CloudWatch_Status_Custom_V2",
      "action": "aws:runCommand",
      "inputs": {
        "DocumentName": "Check_CloudWatch_Status_Custom_V2",
        "InstanceIds": [
          "{{ instanceid }}"
        ]
      },
      "outputs": [
        {
          "Name": "CloudWatchStatusOutput",
          "Selector": "$.StandardOutputContent",
          "Type": "String"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "PrintOutput",
      "action": "aws:runShellScript",
      "inputs": {
        "runCommand": [
          "echo \"CloudWatch status is {{ Check_CloudWatch_Status_Custom_V2.CloudWatchStatusOutput }}\""
        ]
      }
    }
    // ... other steps
  ]
}

Summary for JSON:


---

Important

Selector $.StandardOutputContent is commonly correct for aws:runCommand.

If wrong, you can run manually once and check output format.

Make sure JSON commas , are properly placed between steps.

No extra comma after the last step.

Would you also like me to show how to use this variable inside a Precondition (in JSON)?
If you want, I can prepare that too!
(very helpful if you are dynamically deciding Install/Configure based on output!)

Let me know!
