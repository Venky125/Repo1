Thanks for the clarity. Since you're already using python3.8 in your document, here's how you can safely print the output from the parent document using the aws:executeScript step.

Example Step: Print Linux Install Status Using Python 3.8

- name: PrintLinuxStatus
  action: aws:executeScript
  inputs:
    Runtime: python3.8
    Handler: script_handler
    Script: |
      def script_handler(events, context):
          linux_status = events.get("LinuxStatus", "Unknown")
          print("Linux Install Status:", linux_status)
          return {"message": linux_status}
    InputPayload:
      LinuxStatus: "{{ CheckCWStatus.LinuxInstallStatus }}"

Explanation:

Runtime: Using python3.8 (as expected by the Automation service).

InputPayload: Injects the output from the parent document.

Script: Prints and returns the value, helpful for debugging.

Let me know if you'd also like a version for printing Windows Install Status or anything else!
