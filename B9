Given that you're using Schema version 0.3, there are some constraints in how certain steps are defined. This version supports a specific set of actions, and it looks like the issue might be related to syntax or action compatibility with the version you're using.

Adjustments for Schema Version 0.3:

For version 0.3, the aws:runShellScript action may not be available, and the use of StandardOutputContent might also be restricted. Instead, you should rely on aws:runCommand and other supported actions.

Here's a simple approach to print the value in the current version:

Corrected Example for Schema Version 0.3:

version: '0.3'
steps:
  - name: CheckLinuxInstallStatus
    action: aws:runCommand
    inputs:
      documentName: AWS-RunShellScript
      parameters:
        commands:
          - echo "Checking if Linux is installed"
    outputs:
      - Name: LinuxInstallStatus
        Selector: $.StandardOutput
        Type: String

  - name: DebugStep
    action: aws:runCommand
    inputs:
      documentName: AWS-RunShellScript
      parameters:
        commands:
          - echo "LinuxInstallStatus: {{CheckLinuxInstallStatus.LinuxInstallStatus}}"

  - name: DecideNextActionLinux
    action: aws:branch
    inputs:
      Choices:
        - Variable: "{{CheckLinuxInstallStatus.LinuxInstallStatus}}"
          StringEquals: "LinuxInstalled"
          NextStep: CheckLinuxConfigStatus
        - Variable: "{{CheckLinuxInstallStatus.LinuxInstallStatus}}"
          StringEquals: "Configured"
          NextStep: AlreadyConfigured
      DefaultStep: InstallCWAgent

Key Changes:

1. Action: aws:runCommand: In version 0.3, you should use aws:runCommand with AWS-RunShellScript to run commands on an instance.


2. StandardOutput vs StandardOutputContent: In version 0.3, we use $.StandardOutput instead of $.StandardOutputContent for capturing the output of commands run by aws:runCommand.


3. aws:runCommand instead of aws:runShellScript: The action type aws:runShellScript is not available in 0.3, so we use aws:runCommand to execute shell commands, which works in this schema version.


4. Use of Selector: $.StandardOutput: This will capture the standard output from the aws:runCommand action, which is the output you're trying to use in subsequent steps.



Notes:

The StandardOutput captures the output of commands executed by aws:runCommand and makes that available for subsequent steps.

Be sure that the YAML indentation is correct, as improper indentation can cause syntax errors in AWS Systems Manager documents.
