Thanks for the clarity. Since you have separate outputs for installation and configuration statuses, we’ll not combine them during status evaluation, and instead check them independently as you initially requested.

Expected Status Outputs from Status Check Document

For Linux and Windows, you get two different outputs:

Install status:

Cloud watch agent is Installed

Cloud watch agent is Not-Installed


Configure status:

Cloud watch agent is Configured

Cloud watch agent is Not-Configured




---

Updated Logic Summary (Only One Flow Executes)

1. Status Check — Get separate install and configure statuses for Linux/Windows.


2. If Not-Installed —
→ Install CW agent
→ Configure based on platform
→ Output: "CloudWatch agent has been installed and configured."
→ isEnd: true


3. If Installed but Not-Configured —
→ Configure based on platform
→ Output: "CloudWatch agent has been configured."
→ isEnd: true


4. If Installed and Configured —
→ Output: "CloudWatch agent is already installed and configured."
→ isEnd: true

What Changed

Separate outputs for install and configure per platform are now respected.

No combined status checks.

isEnd: true is present at the end of each possible flow, exactly twice.

Install CW agent, ConfigureCWagentLinux, and ConfigureCWAgentWindows steps retained with same names as you provided.


Let me know if you'd like me to validate the JSON version or simulate the output!
