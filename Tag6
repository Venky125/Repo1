You can use Terraform's data sources to filter EC2 instances based on a specific tag, store the instance IDs in a variable, and print them as output. Below is the complete Terraform script to achieve this.


---

Terraform Code:

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"  # Change this to your desired AWS region
}

# Define the tag key and value to filter instances
variable "filter_tag_key" {
  default = "Environment"  # Change this to your desired tag key
}

variable "filter_tag_value" {
  default = "Production"  # Change this to your desired tag value
}

# Fetch all EC2 instance IDs
data "aws_instances" "filtered" {
  filter {
    name   = "tag:${var.filter_tag_key}"
    values = [var.filter_tag_value]
  }
}

# Store filtered instance IDs in a variable
variable "filtered_instance_ids" {
  default = []
}

locals {
  instance_ids = data.aws_instances.filtered.ids
}

# Output the stored EC2 instance IDs
output "filtered_ec2_instances" {
  value = local.instance_ids
}

How It Works:

1. aws_instances Data Source: Filters EC2 instances based on a specified tag key and value.


2. Variables filter_tag_key and filter_tag_value: Define which tag to filter EC2 instances by.


3. locals Block: Stores the filtered instance IDs.


4. Output Block: Prints the instance IDs.

How to Run:

terraform init
terraform apply

This will output the list of EC2 instance IDs that match the specified tag.
