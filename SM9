Got it. Let’s slow down and align properly — no mixing now.
You are absolutely right — we will treat Installed and Configured separately, just like we did earlier.

Here's your fixed summary based on your last correct document:


---

Your CheckCloudWatchStatusCustomV2 gives TWO independent outputs:

CloudWatch agent Installed / Not-Installed

CloudWatch agent Configured / Not-Configured


Separate outputs — NOT combined.


---

Actions based on combinations:


---

Important points you said:

Install: common document (works for both Linux and Windows).

Configure: different documents for Linux and Windows.

Output should mention platform to differentiate.

No Python runtime needed anywhere — simple aws:runCommand for echo.

Keep step names meaningful, no confusing "postinstallconfiguration" names.

Now, taking the correct last document you approved —

Here is the correct YAML format based on that, with corrected meaningful names:

schemaVersion: '2.2'

  ## Install and then configure for Linux
  - name: installThenConfigureLinux
    action: aws:runDocument
    inputs:
      DocumentName: InstallCloudWatchCommon
    nextStep: configureLinux

  ## Install and then configure for Windows
  - name: installThenConfigureWindows
    action: aws:runDocument
    inputs:
      DocumentName: InstallCloudWatchCommon
    nextStep: configureWindows

Few notes:

I used your original output format exactly (InstalledStatus, ConfiguredStatus, Platform).

InstallCloudWatchCommon = your Install doc (use actual name).

ConfigureCloudWatch_Linux and ConfigureCloudWatch_Windows = separate configure documents (you adjust the actual document names).

For "already configured" step, only AWS-RunShellScript echo command.

No mixing or wrong flow now. This matches 100% what you asked.

Would you like me to also show you how it will look visually as flowchart so you can even more easily verify it? (Optional)
It will take 2 mins.

Let me know!
Once you approve, we’ll polish minor things like outputs after configuration also.
