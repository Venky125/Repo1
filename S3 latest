Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to creating an S3 bucket, assigning a role and policy, and performing basic operations like listing, copying, and deleting files using both the AWS CLI and AWS Console.


---

Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket

Using AWS Console

1. Go to the AWS S3 Console.


2. Click Create bucket.


3. Enter a unique bucket name (e.g., my-demo-bucket-123).


4. Choose a Region (e.g., us-east-1).


5. Block all public access (recommended for security).


6. Enable S3 Versioning (optional for tracking file changes).


7. Click Create bucket.



Using AWS CLI

aws s3 mb s3://my-demo-bucket-123 --region us-east-1


---

Step 2: Create and Assign an IAM Role

Using AWS Console

1. Go to IAM > Roles.


2. Click Create role.


3. Select AWS Service > Choose S3.


4. Attach the AmazonS3FullAccess policy (for full access) OR create a custom policy.



Custom Policy (For Limited Access)

Create a policy that allows list, upload, and delete operations:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-demo-bucket-123",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-demo-bucket-123/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

5. Name the policy S3BasicAccess and attach it to the role.


6. Attach the role to your EC2 instance (if required).

Step 3: Upload a File to S3

Using AWS Console

1. Go to the S3 Console.


2. Open your bucket (my-demo-bucket-123).


3. Click Upload, select a file, and click Upload.



Using AWS CLI

aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://my-demo-bucket-123/


---

Step 4: List Files in S3 Bucket

Using AWS CLI

aws s3 ls s3://my-demo-bucket-123/


---

Step 5: Copy a File from One S3 Location to Another

Using AWS CLI

aws s3 cp s3://my-demo-bucket-123/myfile.txt s3://my-demo-bucket-123/myfile-copy.txt


---

Step 6: Delete a File from S3

Using AWS CLI

aws s3 rm s3://my-demo-bucket-123/myfile.txt


---

Step 7: Delete an S3 Bucket (After Emptying)

Using AWS CLI

aws s3 rb s3://my-demo-bucket-123 --force


---

This setup ensures secure access while allowing file operations in S3. Let me know if you need further refinements!
