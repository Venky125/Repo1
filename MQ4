Perfect! Here's what you're asking:


---

‚úÖ Final Requirement:

After finding an AMQ9456I message with today‚Äôs date (8 lines above), also look ahead for the string:

The remote queue manager is out of step

Then:

When found, print 10 lines starting from that line.

‚úÖ What This Script Does:

For each match of AMQ9456I with today's date:

Prints 8 lines before, the AMQ9456I line, and 1 line after

Then scans forward for:

The remote queue manager is out of step

If found, prints that line + 9 more (total 10 lines).

If not found, prints a message saying it wasn‚Äôt found.


Appends everything into /tmp/amq9456_today_only.log.

üìù Example Output Block:

File: /MQ/xyz/data/qmgrs/ABC/errors/AMQERR01.LOG
06/18/2025 ...
...
AMQ9456I: The SSL connection was closed
...
-- Remote QM Out of Step Block --
The remote queue manager is out of step ...
... (next 9 lines)
----

Let me know if you'd like to:

Search further ahead (e.g., 100 lines instead of stopping soon)

Extract only the remote QM section into a different log

Highlight the section or timestamp in output
