Here's your AWS SSM document that checks whether the CloudWatch Agent is installed and configured on both Linux and Windows EC2 instances.

How It Works:

1. For Linux:

Checks if /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl exists to verify installation.

Checks if /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/etc/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.toml exists to verify configuration.



2. For Windows:

Checks if C:\Program Files\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl.ps1 exists to verify installation.

Checks if C:\ProgramData\Amazon\AmazonCloudWatchAgent\amazon-cloudwatch-agent.toml exists to verify configuration.




You can use this document in AWS Run Command to execute on multiple EC2 instances and check their CloudWatch Agent status. Let me know if you need any modifications!
