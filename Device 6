Apologies for the confusion earlier. The issue is that block_device_mappings is not directly available in the aws_instance data source, which is causing the error. Instead, we will need to use a different approach by explicitly fetching block device details through the aws_instance resource.

Hereâ€™s how we can fix it:

Key Concept:

You can only access the block_device_mappings by using aws_instance resources (not data sources).

Since block_device_mappings is an attribute on the aws_instance resource, you need to use a dynamic resource for each EC2 instance to access its block devices.


Solution: Use aws_instance resource to fetch device names.

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"  # Replace with your desired region
}

# Fetch the instance IDs
data "aws_instances" "all" {}

# Define an aws_instance resource for each instance ID to get block device mappings
resource "aws_instance" "instances" {
  for_each = toset(data.aws_instances.all.ids)

  instance_id = each.value
}

# Output the device names for each instance
output "instance_device_names" {
  value = [
    for instance in aws_instance.instances : {
      instance_id = instance.id
      device_names = [
        for device in instance.block_device_mappings : device.device_name
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Key Notes:

1. resource "aws_instance" "instances": This resource is used to fetch block device mappings for each EC2 instance by specifying instance_id = each.value. Each instance is created as a resource, which allows you to fetch block_device_mappings.


2. instance.block_device_mappings: This attribute is now available for the aws_instance resource, and you can access the device_name for each attached volume.



Expected Output:

The output will list the device names for all instances, and you should not encounter any errors now.

Why This Works:

The key difference is using the aws_instance resource (instead of a data source) to get the block device mappings.

Resources have access to all instance-specific attributes like block_device_mappings, unlike data sources, which are more limited.


Give this approach a try, and let me know if you encounter any further issues!
