Got it â€” you are 100% right.

In SSM precondition, if you want to combine and and or,
you must group them properly using parentheses ( ).

Otherwise it gives error like:

> "Precondition must have only 1 root."

Now carefully read:

If you want:

> (installStatus == Not-Installed) and (platform == Linux or platform == Windows)



You must write it like this:

precondition:
  "{{ installStatus == 'Not-Installed' and (platform == 'Linux' or platform == 'Windows') }}"

Notice:

and comes first

or group is wrapped inside ( )

Correct parentheses are important!

Example for your Install Step:

- name: InstallCWAgent
  action: aws:runDocument
  precondition:
    "{{ installStatus == 'Not-Installed' and (platform == 'Linux' or platform == 'Windows') }}"
  inputs:
    documentName: Install-CloudWatch-Agent
  isEnd: false


---

Similarly, for Configure Linux Step:

You want:

> (configStatus == Not-Configured) and (platform == Linux)



Simple:

- name: ConfigureCWAgentLinux
  action: aws:runDocument
  precondition:
    "{{ configStatus == 'Not-Configured' and platform == 'Linux' }}"
  inputs:
    documentName: Configure-CWAgent-Linux
  isEnd: true


---

Summary of Rule:

Use double curly braces {{ ... }} around whole expression.

Inside, if mixing and + or, use brackets ( ... ) properly.

Expression should look like pure Python boolean expression.

Otherwise SSM cannot parse and gives root error.

Would you like me to correct your full document accordingly with proper parentheses and send it?

(Ready in 2 mins if you want!)
Just say yes!
