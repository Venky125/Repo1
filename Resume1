Absolutely! Here's a structured list of practical Terraform bullet points, aligned just like the AWS services list — ideal for your resume, interview prep, or even a project documentation summary.

Each point is focused on real-world infrastructure engineering outcomes, not just tool usage:

✅ Terraform – Resume-Style Bullet Points

1. Infrastructure Provisioning

Provisioned and managed scalable cloud infrastructure (VPC, EC2, S3, IAM) using Terraform to ensure consistency and automation across environments.


2. Modular Configuration

Developed reusable and modular Terraform code for commonly used AWS components, improving maintainability and reducing duplication.


3. Remote State Management

Configured remote state storage using S3 backend with DynamoDB for state locking, enabling safe collaboration in a team setup.


4. Variables and Outputs

Utilized input variables, locals, and output values for flexible environment-specific configurations and easier integration between modules.


5. Resource Dependency Management

Leveraged depends_on and implicit dependencies in Terraform to manage resource provisioning order and avoid race conditions.


6. Terraform Workspaces

Managed multiple environments (dev, stage, prod) using Terraform workspaces, allowing isolated state management across accounts or regions.


7. Plan & Apply Workflow

Used terraform plan and terraform apply in CI pipelines and local runs to safely validate and deploy infrastructure changes.


8. State Inspection & Troubleshooting

Investigated resource drift and resolved issues using terraform state, terraform taint, and targeted resource re-application.


9. Policy Compliance

Integrated tagging and IAM naming conventions into Terraform modules to enforce cost, compliance, and access policies.


10. CI/CD Integration

(Optional, if applicable) Integrated Terraform into CI/CD workflows to perform automated infrastructure deployments using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.

If you're not using CI/CD yet for Terraform, you can skip #10.

Would you like these included in a full resume section layout with headings like “Key Projects,” “DevOps Tools,” or “Cloud Infrastructure Engineering”? I can also create a formatted version for LinkedIn if needed.
