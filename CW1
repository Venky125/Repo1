Alright, let’s go step-by-step from the very start for your two different CloudWatch Agent version plan, including AMI preparation and Terraform integration.


---

Step 1 – Maintain Versions as Variables

In your Terraform code, define variables for both CloudWatch Agent versions.


variable "cw_agent_version_v1" {
  default = "1.247356.0b251908"
}

variable "cw_agent_version_v2" {
  default = "1.247361.0b252105"
}

You can later decide which one to use in test vs production by referencing the right variable.



---

Step 2 – Build AMIs with Pre-installed CloudWatch Agent

We’ll use Packer here (triggered by Terraform or manually) to create AMIs that already have CloudWatch installed.

Example Packer snippet (Linux example):

{
  "builders": [{
    "type": "amazon-ebs",
    "region": "ap-south-1",
    "source_ami": "ami-xxxxxxxx",  
    "instance_type": "t3.micro",
    "ssh_username": "ec2-user",
    "ami_name": "cw-agent-{{user `cw_agent_version`}}-{{timestamp}}"
  }],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "inline": [
        "sudo yum install -y amazon-cloudwatch-agent-{{user `cw_agent_version`}}"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Run Packer twice with different cw_agent_version values to create two AMIs.

Store AMI IDs in Terraform variables or SSM Parameter Store.



---

Step 3 – Test in EC2 Instances

In Terraform, launch EC2 instances using the AMI for the test environment.


resource "aws_instance" "cw_agent_test" {
  ami           = var.cw_agent_ami_id_v1
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "CW-Agent-Test-V1"
  }
}

Validate:

CloudWatch agent service is running.

Config file matches your requirement.

Metrics are flowing to CloudWatch.




---

Step 4 – Approval and Release to Compute Team

Once tested, share AMI ID and version number with the compute team.

They include the AMI in their official release list.

They may apply launch templates or autoscaling groups that reference this AMI.



---

Step 5 – Central Push to All Instances

For existing instances that don’t have the updated agent, Terraform can:

1. Create SSM Association to install the package with a version:



resource "aws_ssm_association" "install_cw_agent_v1" {
  name = "AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage"
  targets {
    key    = "tag:Environment"
    values = ["Prod"]
  }
  parameters = {
    action  = ["Install"]
    name    = ["AmazonCloudWatchAgent"]
    version = [var.cw_agent_version_v1]
  }
}

2. Use different associations for V1 and V2, targeting them based on EC2 tags (tag:CWVersion = v1 or v2).




---

Step 6 – Version Tracking

Keep a simple mapping in SSM Parameter Store:

/cw-agent/version/test → 1.247356.0b251908

/cw-agent/version/prod → 1.247361.0b252105


Terraform can read this dynamically so no hardcoding.



---

If you want, I can make you a Terraform + Packer pipeline so you:

Change version → run build → AMI gets created → Terraform updates test → after approval → rollout to all.


Do you want me to make that combined workflow?
