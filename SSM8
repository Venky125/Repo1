Good catch!
Yes â€” an SSM document (YAML format) needs top-level {} ({} open and close brackets) if you are uploading it using APIs/CLI, or else AWS console automatically adds it.

I'll now give you the fully correct final version with brackets:

FINAL Correct SSM Document

{
  "schemaVersion": "2.2",
  "description": "Check whether CloudWatch Agent is installed and configured on Linux and Windows EC2 instances.",
  "parameters": {},

Notes for Usage:

You can paste this JSON when creating a "Command or Session Document" inside AWS SSM > Documents > Create.

Or use it via AWS CLI if you prefer.

Once attached, target 1 Linux and 1 Windows instance to test it.

Outputs will show directly in the Command output.

Would you like me to also show you how it would look if you wanted a version that outputs "SUCCESS"/"FAILURE" codes too for easy monitoring? (optional if you want to automate next steps)
Let me know!
