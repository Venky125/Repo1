In Apache Kafka, KRaft (Kafka Raft) is a new metadata management system that replaces ZooKeeper for managing Kafka's cluster metadata.

Key Features of KRaft in Kafka:

1. ZooKeeper-Free Architecture – KRaft eliminates the need for ZooKeeper, simplifying deployment and reducing operational complexity.


2. Raft-Based Consensus – Uses the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure high availability and consistency of metadata across Kafka brokers.


3. Better Scalability – KRaft allows Kafka to scale to larger clusters with lower metadata overhead.


4. Improved Stability & Performance – Reduces metadata update latencies and enhances the broker failover process.


5. Single Process Mode – Kafka brokers can now manage metadata within the Kafka process itself, removing dependency on an external coordination service.



Why Kafka Moved to KRaft?

ZooKeeper introduced performance bottlenecks as Kafka clusters grew.

Managing metadata separately in ZooKeeper created operational complexities.

Raft provides a simpler, more scalable way to maintain consensus.


KRaft Mode vs. ZooKeeper Mode

KRaft is the future of Kafka metadata management, and starting from Kafka 3.3+, KRaft is production-ready, with plans to fully remove ZooKeeper support in future releases.
