To print the output directly in the decideNextAction step, you can use a aws:runShellScript action inside the decideNextAction step, like this:

Here’s the adjusted code to print the output of the first step directly in the decideNextAction step:

steps:
  - name: mainstep
    action: aws:runShellScript
    inputs:
      runCommand:
        - echo "LinuxInstalled"
    outputs:
      - Name: LinuxInstalledStatus
        Selector: $.StandardOutputContent
        Type: String

  - name: decideNextAction
    action: aws:branch
    inputs:
      Choices:
        - Variable: "{{mainstep.LinuxInstalledStatus}}"
          StringEquals: "LinuxInstalled"
          NextStep: CheckLinuxConfigStatus
        - Variable: "{{mainstep.LinuxInstalledStatus}}"
          StringEquals: "Configured"
          NextStep: AlreadyConfigured
      DefaultStep: InstallCWAgent
    nextStep: aws:runShellScript  # Adding a runShellScript step to print the output here
    inputs:
      runCommand:
        - echo "LinuxInstalledStatus: {{mainstep.LinuxInstalledStatus}}"

Key Changes:

1. decideNextAction Step:

After determining the path to proceed (either CheckLinuxConfigStatus, AlreadyConfigured, or InstallCWAgent), I’ve added a nextStep that runs a aws:runShellScript to print the value of LinuxInstalledStatus.



2. runShellScript:

Inside decideNextAction, we run a script using aws:runShellScript to echo the output of LinuxInstalledStatus (which is set in the mainstep).




Expected Behavior:

The echo inside decideNextAction will print the value of LinuxInstalledStatus, so you can verify whether it's getting the correct value or not before making decisions.

After printing the value, it will proceed with the NextStep based on the conditions defined (checking for LinuxInstalled or Configured).


Debugging:

This will help you print the value of LinuxInstalledStatus right before you decide which step to proceed with.

Make sure to check the Step Output logs in AWS Systems Manager to confirm if the value is printed correctly.
