To install OpenTelemetry on a Linux system and collect metrics and traces using AWS CloudWatch Agent, follow these steps:


---

1. Install AWS CloudWatch Agent

AWS CloudWatch Agent helps in collecting metrics and logs.

Amazon Linux / Ubuntu / Debian

sudo yum install -y amazon-cloudwatch-agent  # Amazon Linux / RHEL
sudo apt install -y amazon-cloudwatch-agent  # Ubuntu / Debian

Start and Enable the Agent

sudo systemctl enable amazon-cloudwatch-agent
sudo systemctl start amazon-cloudwatch-agent


---

2. Install OpenTelemetry Collector

The OpenTelemetry Collector receives traces and metrics before exporting them to AWS.

Download and Install

sudo wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/latest/download/otelcol-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/otelcol
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/otelcol

Verify Installation

otelcol --version


---

3. Configure AWS CloudWatch Agent for Metrics

Create the CloudWatch Agent configuration file:

sudo nano /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/etc/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json

Paste the following configuration:

{
    "metrics": {
        "metrics_collected": {
            "mem": {
                "measurement": ["mem_used_percent"]
            },
            "cpu": {
                "measurement": ["cpu_usage_user", "cpu_usage_system"]
            }
        }
    },
    "logs": {
        "logs_collected": {
            "files": {
                "collect_list": [
                    {
                        "file_path": "/var/log/syslog",
                        "log_group_name": "syslog",
                        "log_stream_name": "{instance_id}"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}

Save and restart the CloudWatch Agent:

sudo systemctl restart amazon-cloudwatch-agent


---

4. Configure OpenTelemetry Collector

Create the configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/otel-config.yaml

Paste the following:

receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

exporters:
  awsxray:
  awsemf:
    namespace: "MyApp/Metrics"
    log_group_name: "/aws/otel/application-metrics"

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [awsxray]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [awsemf]


---

5. Run OpenTelemetry Collector

Start the OpenTelemetry Collector manually:

otelcol --config /etc/otel-config.yaml

To run it as a background service:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/otelcol.service

Paste:

[Unit]
Description=OpenTelemetry Collector
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/otelcol --config /etc/otel-config.yaml
Restart=always
User=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Save and start the service:

sudo systemctl enable otelcol
sudo systemctl start otelcol


---

6. Verify OpenTelemetry Data in AWS

Go to AWS X-Ray → Check traces.

Go to AWS CloudWatch → Check metrics under MyApp/Metrics.
