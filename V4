Great! To allow SSM Run Command to write outputs to your S3 bucket, you need to do two things:


---

1. Add a bucket policy to allow SSM to write outputs

Go to S3 console > Your bucket > Permissions > Bucket policy, and add this:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowSSMOutput",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ssm.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:SourceAccount": "your-aws-account-id"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

Replace:

your-bucket-name with your actual bucket name.

your-aws-account-id with your 12-digit AWS Account ID.

2. Ensure the IAM role used by SSM (usually AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore) allows writing to S3

If you're using EC2-managed instance with SSM, the instance profile (role attached to EC2) must have this permission:

{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:PutObject"
  ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
}

You can attach a custom policy to the instance role, or create a new policy with this permission.


---

Optional: Enable SSM command output to S3 in Run Command

When sending a Run Command (like via console, CLI, or SSM document), specify:

S3 bucket name

(Optional) S3 key prefix â€“ e.g., ssm-logs/


You can do this using:

AWS CLI --output-s3-bucket-name and --output-s3-key-prefix

Or in SSM Documents, using "OutputS3BucketName" and "OutputS3KeyPrefix" under aws:runCommand or aws:runShellScript.

Let me know if you'd like a sample JSON of the full Run Command document or CLI command with output to S3!
