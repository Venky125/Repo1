Ok, understood your situation now very clearly.

Let’s step-by-step fix it:


---

Important Concept in SSM "precondition"

1. SSM precondition must have exactly one root key — either And: or Or:.


2. Inside And: or Or:, you can have multiple expressions.


3. You cannot put And and Or at the same level directly.

And must contain Or inside it properly indented.



4. No brackets syntax like programming (SSM precondition is YAML based).




---

Correct way (full syntax)

Example — you want:

installStatus == Not-Installed

AND (platform == Linux OR platform == Windows)



---

Here’s correct YAML:

precondition:
  And:
    - "{{ installStatus }} == Not-Installed"
    - Or:
        - "{{ platform }} == Linux"
        - "{{ platform }} == Windows"

Key:

Root is And

Inside And, you have two entries:

First is direct comparison

Second is another block Or with two comparisons




---

Wrong way (what you are trying):

precondition:
  And: "{{ installStatus }} == Not-Installed" Or "{{ platform }} == Linux" "{{ platform }} == Windows"

Why wrong?

Only one root allowed.

YAML needs structure (nested).



---

Visual Structure:

precondition
 └── And
      ├── condition1
      └── Or
           ├── condition2
           └── condition3


---

Conclusion

Use proper nesting.

No brackets ( ) like programming.

And must be parent. Or inside it.

Write each condition as separate item (starting with -)



---

Do you want me to update your full YAML with this corrected style and give ready final version?

(no StringEquals, using ==, clean nesting, isEnd true, everything)

Just say: "Give final corrected YAML"
I'll give fully working version!
