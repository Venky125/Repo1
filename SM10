Alright — I clearly get your frustration now.
Let’s slow it down and fix this properly.

You are absolutely right:

> In ConfigureOnly, it should NOT directly go ahead,
It should first check platform and then call either ConfigureWindows or ConfigureLinux.



Earlier I had shortcut it.
Now, I’ll correct it properly, clean, and logically how you expect.

Here’s the corrected YAML now, based on your original good one:

In Short:


---

What Changed from earlier wrong ones?

BranchConfigureOnly introduced for Installed + Not-Configured

BranchAfterInstall introduced after installation.

Correctly checked Platform for Configure steps.

AlreadyConfigured just does simple echo. No unnecessary python runtime now.

Would you also like me to show you a slightly optimized version after this? (where repeated branch can be minimized a little to make it even cleaner?)
First confirm if this fixed version is okay for you?
(Then I'll show cleaner optional one if you want.)

Take your time to read this properly and tell me.
No more rushing!
