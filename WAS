Got it —
You are saying:

You already have the WebSphere core installation (8.5.5.26) ready as a tar file.

You untar this core installation on any new server where you need WebSphere.

Now you want steps to create new profiles (Dmgr, Node, etc.) manually after untarring.


Right?
If yes, this is very simple — I’ll give you clear working steps:


---

Steps to use tar-based WebSphere and create profiles (Dmgr, Node etc.)


---

1. Untar the WebSphere package

First, copy the tar file to your target machine and untar it:

cd /opt/IBM
tar -xvf WAS85526.tar

(Assuming you are keeping WebSphere under /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer)

Now your WebSphere base binaries are ready.


---

2. Set permissions (optional but recommended)

Ensure proper permissions for the WebSphere directories:

chown -R wasuser:wasgroup /opt/IBM/WebSphere
chmod -R 755 /opt/IBM/WebSphere

(Replace wasuser and wasgroup with your WebSphere OS user and group.)


---

3. Create Profiles using manageprofiles.sh

Go to the bin directory:

cd /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/bin

Now use manageprofiles.sh to create your profiles:


---

Create Dmgr profile (Deployment Manager):

./manageprofiles.sh -create -profileName Dmgr01 \
 -profilePath /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/Dmgr01 \
 -templatePath /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profileTemplates/management \
 -nodeName DmgrNode01 \
 -cellName Cell01

Explanation:

-profileName: Logical name for profile.

-profilePath: Filesystem path for profile.

-templatePath: Choose management template for Dmgr.

-nodeName: Name of node (can be anything but generally ends with "Node").

-cellName: Name of cell (important for federation later).



---

Create AppServer (Node) profile:

./manageprofiles.sh -create -profileName AppSrv01 \
 -profilePath /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv01 \
 -templatePath /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profileTemplates/default \
 -nodeName Node01

Explanation:

default template is for a standalone AppServer (Node) profile.



---

Important Options You May Want to Add:

-serverName server1 → if you want to customize the default server name.

-adminUserName and -adminPassword → if you want secured (enabled) admin security at creation time.


Example with security:

./manageprofiles.sh -create -profileName Dmgr01 \
 -profilePath /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/Dmgr01 \
 -templatePath /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profileTemplates/management \
 -nodeName DmgrNode01 \
 -cellName Cell01 \
 -adminUserName wasadmin \
 -adminPassword YourPassword123


---

4. Start the profiles

Start Deployment Manager:

/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/Dmgr01/bin/startManager.sh

Start AppServer (Node):

/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv01/bin/startServer.sh server1


---

5. (Optional) Federate Node to Dmgr

If you created separate nodes and you want them managed by Dmgr, you need to federate:

/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv01/bin/addNode.sh dmgr_hostname dmgr_soap_port

Example:

./addNode.sh dmgrhost.example.com 8879

(Default SOAP port for Dmgr is usually 8879.)

Would you also like me to give a sample shell script that automates all these steps?
(so you just run the script and everything happens) —
Takes 2 mins to prepare if you want.
(Yes/No)?
