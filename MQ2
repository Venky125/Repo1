Got it! Let's take the finalized version of your script from earlier (where we printed 8 lines above and the matching line) and just modify it to also print the next line (NR+1) â€” without switching to END block logic or changing too much.

But to do this correctly (since awk doesn't have access to the next line at the time it matches), we need to read ahead just one line using a queue-like buffer.

âœ… Finalized Script (Minimal Change, Includes Next Line After AMQ9456I)

#!/bin/bash

# Output log file
output_log="/tmp/amq9456_today_only.log"
: > "$output_log"  # Clear existing content

# Get today's date in MM/DD/YYYY format
today=$(date +"%m/%d/%Y")

# Process all AMQERR01.LOG files
for file in /MQ/*/data/qmgrs/*/errors/AMQERR01.LOG; do
    awk -v t1="$today" -v fname="$file" '
    {
        lines[NR] = $0
    }

    NR > 1 {
        prev_line = lines[NR-1]
    }

    /AMQ9456I/ {
        if ((NR-8) in lines) {
            date_line = lines[NR-8]
            if (date_line ~ t1) {
                print "File: " fname
                for (i = NR-8; i <= NR+1; i++) {
                    if ((i) in lines)
                        print lines[i]
                    else if (i == NR+1) {
                        # Read next line manually if not already read
                        getline next_line
                        print next_line
                    }
                }
                print "----"
            }
        }
    }
    ' "$file"
done >> "$output_log"

âœ… Whatâ€™s Changed

Kept your original line-buffer logic (lines[NR] = $0).

For NR+1:

If already read, we print from the array.

If not (which it won't be), we do getline next_line to read it manually at that point.

ðŸ§ª Example Output Block (in /tmp/amq9456_today_only.log) might look like:

File: /MQ/mq1/data/qmgrs/QM1/errors/AMQERR01.LOG
06/18/2025 10:21:15 - Process(1001.2) ...
...
AMQ9456I: The system SSL configuration ...
<next line after AMQ9456I>

Let me know if:

You want this script to check for last 2 days instead of just today.

You want to include .1, .2 log files (rotated logs).

You want the output sorted or grouped.
