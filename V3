Got it — you want the new SSM document in YAML format, matching the style you already have.

Here’s the YAML version based on your setup:

schemaVersion: '2.2'
description: 'Check CloudWatch Agent Status and Install/Configure if required for Linux'
parameters: {}
mainSteps:
  - name: checkCloudWatchStatus
    action: aws:runDocument
    inputs:
      DocumentName: "check_cloudwatch_status_custom"
    outputs:
      - Name: Status
        Selector: "$.Payload"
        Type: String

  - name: decideNextAction
    action: aws:branch
    inputs:
      Choices:
        - NextStep: installCloudWatchAgent
          StringEquals:
            - "{{ checkCloudWatchStatus.Status }}"
            - "Cloud watch agent is Not-Installed"
        - NextStep: configureCloudWatchAgent
          StringEquals:
            - "{{ checkCloudWatchStatus.Status }}"
            - "Cloud watch agent is Not-Configured"
        - NextStep: successExit
          Or:
            - StringEquals:
                - "{{ checkCloudWatchStatus.Status }}"
                - "Cloudwatch agent is Configured"
            - StringEquals:
                - "{{ checkCloudWatchStatus.Status }}"
                - "Cloud watch agent is Installed"

  - name: installCloudWatchAgent
    action: aws:runDocument
    inputs:
      DocumentName: "AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage"
      Parameters:
        action: "Install"
        name: "AmazonCloudWatchAgent"

  - name: configureCloudWatchAgent
    action: aws:runDocument
    inputs:
      DocumentName: "your-configure-cloudwatch-ssm-document-name" # <-- Replace this with your actual SSM document name that configures CW agent
    onFailure: Abort

  - name: successExit
    action: aws:runShellScript
    inputs:
      runCommand:
        - echo "CloudWatch agent is already installed and configured. No action needed."

Key Points:

Step 1: Call your existing check_cloudwatch_status_custom document.

Step 2: Based on output (Payload), decide next action:

If Not-Installed → Install Agent

If Not-Configured → Configure Agent

If already Installed and Configured → Simply exit after echo.


Install Step: Uses AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage document to install CloudWatch Agent.

Configure Step: You have to replace your-configure-cloudwatch-ssm-document-name with your actual document for configuring CW agent.

Would you also like me to show how the flow changes if Windows is also involved? (In that case, we can branch based on platformType like Linux or Windows additionally.)
Let me know!
