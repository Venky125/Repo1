Great — you're almost there! Since your script writes to a log file (/tmp/amq9456_today_only.log), and you want to send an email notification only when something is written, here's how to do it.


---

✅ Step-by-Step Integration: Send Email If Log Has Data

Assuming:

You already have SMTP server details, a subject, and email content (body).

You’re using sendmail, mailx, or a modern SMTP tool like msmtp or mail.

📍 1. Final Script Structure (Add Email Check at End)

Here's your complete script with the email block added at the end:

#!/bin/bash

# Output log file
output_log="/tmp/amq9456_today_only.log"
: > "$output_log"  # Clear previous content

# Today's date in MM/DD/YYYY format
today=$(date +"%m/%d/%Y")

# Process each log file
for file in /MQ/*/data/qmgrs/*/errors/AMQERR01.LOG; do
    awk -v t1="$today" -v fname="$file" '
    {
        lines[NR] = $0
        max = NR
    }

    END {
        for (i = 9; i <= max; i++) {
            if (lines[i] ~ /AMQ9456I/) {
                date_line = lines[i - 8]
                if (date_line ~ t1) {

                    print ""  # Blank line before main block

                    print "File: " fname
                    for (j = i - 8; j <= i + 1; j++) {
                        if (j in lines) print lines[j]
                    }

                    found = 0
                    for (k = i + 2; k <= max; k++) {
                        if (lines[k] ~ /The remote queue manager is out of step/) {
                            print ""  # Blank line before remote QM block
                            found = 1
                            print "-- Remote QM Out of Step Block --"
                            for (m = k; m < k + 10 && m <= max; m++) {
                                print lines[m]
                            }
                            break
                        }
                    }

                    if (!found) {
                        print ""
                        print "-- No remote queue manager error found after AMQ9456I --"
                    }

                    print "----"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ' "$file"
done >> "$output_log"


---

📬 2. Email Notification Block (Append After Script)

Insert this after the done >> "$output_log" line:

# If log file has content, send email
if [ -s "$output_log" ]; then
    mail_subject="MQ Alert: AMQ9456I detected on $(hostname)"
    mail_body="One or more AMQ9456I entries with today's date were found. Please check the attached log.\n\n$(cat "$output_log")"
    mail_to="your_email@example.com"

    # Using mailx (works on most systems)
    echo -e "$mail_body" | mailx -s "$mail_subject" "$mail_to"

    # Alternative if using sendmail or msmtp – let me know and I’ll adjust for that
fi


---

✅ What This Does:

-s: Sets the subject

echo -e: Includes multiline content (log data)

Sends email only if the log is not empty (-s "$output_log")

🔧 Customize for Your Setup:

If you're using Gmail SMTP, or need to use msmtp or sendmail with auth (SMTP server, port, username, password), I can help set that up.

Just tell me:

Your preferred method: mailx, sendmail, msmtp, or Python with SMTP?

Whether you want to attach the log file or just paste its content into the email body.


Let me know, and I’ll tailor the final step for your exact environment.
