1. Kafka Cluster

A Kafka cluster is a group of Kafka brokers working together to distribute and manage data streams. It provides scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability.

Each broker (server) in the cluster stores and serves data.

Producers send data to the cluster, and consumers read from it.

The cluster manages metadata (like topics, partitions, and replicas) using ZooKeeper (old) or KRaft (new).

2. Partitioning in Kafka

A partition is a way to split a Kafka topic into smaller parts, allowing parallelism and scalability.

Each topic consists of multiple partitions.

Messages within a partition are ordered, but across partitions, there is no global ordering.

Kafka assigns partitions to brokers for load balancing.


Why Partitioning?

Enables parallel processing (multiple consumers can read different partitions).

Distributes the load across multiple brokers.

Helps in fault tolerance when combined with replication.

3. Replication in Kafka

Replication ensures fault tolerance by keeping multiple copies of data across brokers.

Each partition has one leader and multiple followers (replicas).

If the leader broker fails, a follower becomes the new leader.

Replication is controlled by the replication factor (e.g., replication factor = 3 means 3 copies of each partition).


Key Roles in Replication:

Leader – Handles all read and write requests for a partition.

Follower – Syncs data from the leader and takes over if the leader fails.

Partitioning helps with scalability, and replication ensures high availability in a Kafka cluster.
