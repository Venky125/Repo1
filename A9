Perfect ‚Äî if you already have separate Install and Configure steps for both Linux and Windows in your document (or are planning to plug them in), we can simplify the YAML just to check status and branch accordingly.

Here‚Äôs a cleaned-up YAML, focusing only on:

Retrieving output from parent doc

Branching decisions using those outputs

Calling your own install/configure steps by step name only

How to Plug Your Steps

Just define CWInstallLinux, CWConfigureLinux, etc., separately after this block ‚Äî or already have them in the same document.

These can be either aws:runCommand or another aws:executeAutomation or aws:executeScript ‚Äî based on your logic.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like me to plug your exact step definitions for each install/config action into this flow.

Perfect üëç You‚Äôre essentially preparing a decision framework for ‚ÄúKafka Control Center vs Dynatrace‚Äù ‚Äì so I‚Äôll expand my earlier summary into a full evaluation guide. This will include all angles someone might consider while choosing between the two.

üîπ Kafka Control Center vs Dynatrace ‚Äì Complete Comparison

1. Scope of Monitoring

Kafka Control Center

Focuses only on the Kafka ecosystem (brokers, topics, partitions, consumers, ksqlDB, Connect, Schema Registry).

Very deep for Kafka internals (per-topic, per-partition, per-consumer group).

Best for Kafka admins/operators.


Dynatrace

Full-stack observability (apps, Kafka, infra, network, DB, cloud services).

Gives the end-to-end view of how Kafka fits into the wider system.

Best for DevOps/SRE/Observability teams.




---

2. Metrics Coverage

Control Center

Topic throughput (produce/consume rate).

Consumer lag (per group, per partition).

Broker health (controller, under-replicated partitions).

Storage utilization, retention policies.

Confluent-specific (ksqlDB queries, Connect tasks, Schema Registry status).


Dynatrace

Host/infra (CPU, memory, disk, network).

JVM metrics (heap, GC, threads, CPU).

Kafka JMX metrics (lag, throughput, replication, ISR, request latency).

App ‚Üí Kafka ‚Üí DB tracing.

Cloud integration (if Kafka is in AWS MSK, Azure Event Hubs, GCP Pub/Sub).




---

3. Visualization

Control Center

Predefined Kafka dashboards.

Drill-down by topic, partition, consumer group.

Focused and easy for Kafka ops.


Dynatrace

Flexible dashboards (combine Kafka + infra + apps + DB).

Service flow diagrams (Producer ‚Üí Kafka ‚Üí Consumer).

Problem cards with automatic context.




---

4. Alerting & Problem Detection

Control Center

Manual threshold-based alerts (lag > X, under-replicated partitions > 0).

Kafka-specific but reactive.


Dynatrace

AI-powered anomaly detection (Davis AI).

Correlation: e.g., ‚Äúconsumer lag spike caused by broker JVM GC pause.‚Äù

Less manual setup ‚Üí proactive problem detection.




---

5. Granularity

Control Center

Per-topic, per-partition, per-consumer group.

Deepest Kafka visibility possible.


Dynatrace

Good at Kafka JMX metrics but not partition-level detail out-of-the-box.

Broader visibility, less Kafka granularity.




---

6. Integration

Control Center

Tight integration with Confluent ecosystem.

Built-in with Confluent Platform.

No visibility outside Kafka world.


Dynatrace

Integrates with cloud providers, infra, apps, logs, traces.

Can put Kafka in business context (who is impacted if broker fails?).

Not Kafka-native; needs JMX extension for detail.




---

7. Ease of Setup

Control Center

Comes bundled with Confluent Platform.

Minimal extra configuration.

Turnkey for Kafka metrics.


Dynatrace

Install OneAgent + enable JMX.

Needs configuration to capture Kafka details.

More initial setup, but broader benefits.




---

8. Target Users

Control Center ‚Üí Kafka admins, data platform engineers.

Dynatrace ‚Üí DevOps, SRE, infrastructure & app monitoring teams.



---

9. Cost / Licensing

Control Center

Included with Confluent Platform/Enterprise license.

Limited if you‚Äôre using Apache Kafka OSS only (needs Confluent).


Dynatrace

Licensed per host/unit (depending on environment size).

Higher cost, but covers entire ecosystem, not just Kafka.




---

10. Strengths & Weaknesses

‚úÖ Kafka Control Center

Strengths

Deep Kafka-specific metrics (partition, lag, replication).

Easy setup for Kafka monitoring.

Great for debugging Kafka issues at topic/partition level.


Weaknesses

Blind outside Kafka.

No JVM/host/cloud visibility.

Reactive, not AI-driven.



---

‚úÖ Dynatrace

Strengths

End-to-end observability (infra + apps + Kafka + DB).

AI-driven anomaly detection, root cause analysis.

Combines Kafka metrics with app performance.


Weaknesses

Requires configuration for Kafka deep metrics.

Less detailed at Kafka partition level compared to Control Center.

Higher licensing costs.



---

11. When to Choose What

Choose Kafka Control Center if:

Your team is Kafka-centric (platform/data team).

You need deep topic/partition/consumer lag metrics.

You are already using Confluent Platform.


Choose Dynatrace if:

You need full-stack monitoring (infra, apps, DB, Kafka).

You want AI-driven alerts + root cause analysis.

You care about end-to-end tracing across microservices.


Best Practice

Use both together in large enterprises:

Control Center ‚Üí Kafka health.

Dynatrace ‚Üí System-wide impact & correlation.





---

üëâ In a demo, the best way is to pick two scenarios:

1. Broker crash

Control Center ‚Üí shows broker offline.

Dynatrace ‚Üí shows broker process crash + host down + impacted apps.



2. Consumer lag spike

Control Center ‚Üí shows lag at topic/partition level.

Dynatrace ‚Üí shows lag metric + AI root cause (‚Äúcaused by high GC pause‚Äù).
