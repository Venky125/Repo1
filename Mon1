Hereâ€™s a comprehensive list of monitoring parameters for Apache Tomcat and WebSphere Liberty Profile (Liberty), similar to what we discussed for traditional WebSphere.


---

ðŸ”¹ 1. Process & Port Monitoring (Common for Both)

Service/process status: Is Tomcat/Liberty running?

Startup time and uptime

Listening ports:

HTTP, HTTPS

AJP (for Tomcat)


PID tracking for restarts/crashes

Unexpected restarts (via log time comparison or PID change)



---

ðŸ”¹ 2. JVM-Level Monitoring (Same for Tomcat and Liberty)

âœ… Heap & Memory

Total heap vs used heap

Non-heap memory (e.g., metaspace)

GC count and pause times (via JMX or tools like VisualVM, Prometheus)

GC logs (optional: use -Xloggc and parse)


âœ… Thread Monitoring

Total thread count

Thread states (runnable, waiting, blocked)

Deadlocks or stuck threads

Web thread pool usage


Tools: JConsole, JVisualVM, Prometheus JMX Exporter, Micrometer


---

ðŸ”¹ 3. CPU, Memory, and OS Resource Monitoring

JVM CPU usage

Process memory consumption (resident vs virtual memory)

Open file descriptors (Linux: lsof, ulimit)

Disk I/O and log file size growth

Swap usage

Network sockets in use


Tools: top, htop, nmon, or monitoring platforms like Prometheus + Grafana, Datadog, Zabbix, etc.


---

ðŸ”¹ 4. Application Status & Deployment Monitoring

ðŸ”¸ Tomcat

WAR file deployment status

Is the app deployed and accessible?

Check for logs in catalina.out


Context availability (<tomcat_url>/<app-context>/)

WEB-INF/web.xml load errors

Deployment directory monitoring (webapps/)

Servlet or JSP load errors

ServletContextListener load issues

WAR redeploy history (no direct history unless you maintain logs manually)


ðŸ”¸ WebSphere Liberty

Application status via:

Admin Center UI

CLI (server status <serverName>)

REST API (via Open Liberty Admin Center)

JMX (e.g., WebAppMBean)


Deployment success/failure (via messages.log)

EAR/WAR deployment status

Auto-deploy folder status (if used)

Application not started due to missing feature (common in Liberty if server.xml is incomplete)



---

ðŸ”¹ 5. Logs & Error Monitoring

ðŸ”¸ Tomcat

catalina.out, localhost.log, manager.log

Watch for: SEVERE, OutOfMemory, BindException, ServletException



ðŸ”¸ Liberty

messages.log, console.log, ffdc/

Watch for: SRVE, CWWKZ, CWWKE, FFDC entries

Stack traces



Integrate with ELK, Splunk, or Fluentd for log centralization.


---

ðŸ”¹ 6. Thread Pools & Connection Pools

ðŸ”¸ Tomcat

HTTP connector thread pool:

maxThreads, currentThreadsBusy, acceptCount

Monitored via JMX (ThreadPool MBean)


JDBC connection pool (DBCP, HikariCP, etc.)

Active connections

Wait time

Connection leaks



ðŸ”¸ Liberty

WebContainer thread pool size

JNDI JDBC connection pool:

Connection count

Wait time

Leaks or timeouts

Configured via server.xml and monitored via JMX




---

ðŸ”¹ 7. Application-Level Monitoring (Optional but Useful)

Servlet response time (via APM or Prometheus Micrometer)

HTTP error rates (4xx, 5xx)

Session count (active sessions)

Application-specific health endpoints (/health, /actuator, etc.)



---

ðŸ”¹ 8. Security Monitoring

SSL certificate expiry (check keystore/truststore used)

Auth failures (in logs)

Open ports (run nmap scan or netstat)

For Liberty:

JAAS login modules

TLS settings (server.xml)




---

ðŸ”¹ 9. Synthetic & External Monitoring

URL health checks using curl, wget, or synthetic monitoring tools

API endpoint monitoring

Application login-response-logout synthetic scripts



---

ðŸ”¹ 10. Monitoring Tools Support

Feature	Tomcat	Liberty

Native Admin UI	Basic (Manager app)	Admin Center (more advanced)
JMX Support	Yes	Yes
REST Monitoring APIs	No (unless custom)	Yes (Open Liberty supports it)
Logging	catalina.out, etc.	messages.log, FFDC
Application Status	Via Manager app or curl	Admin Center / JMX / REST
Prometheus/Grafana Integration	Yes (via JMX Exporter or Micrometer)	Yes (Micrometer + Liberty metrics)
APM Integration (AppDynamics, etc.)	Yes	Yes



---

âœ… Do You Want?

A JMX monitoring script?

A Prometheus + JMX Exporter setup guide?

Or a spreadsheet checklist to track all components?
