Absolutely 👍
If you’re going to explain Kafka (and compare monitoring tools like Dynatrace vs Control Center), you should also know the core Kafka terminology. I’ll go through each fundamental Kafka concept one by one, in simple but clear language:


---

🔹 Core Kafka Terminology

1. Broker

A Kafka server that stores and serves messages.

A Kafka cluster usually has multiple brokers.

Each broker handles requests from producers and consumers.



---

2. Cluster

A group of Kafka brokers working together.

Provides scalability (more brokers = more capacity) and fault tolerance (data replicated across brokers).



---

3. Topic

A logical channel where messages are published.

Example: A topic named "orders" could store all order events.

Topics are divided into partitions for scalability.



---

4. Partition

A subset of a topic (topics are split into partitions).

Each partition is an ordered, immutable log of messages.

Partitions allow Kafka to scale horizontally (distribute load across brokers).



---

5. Offset

A unique number given to each message in a partition.

Represents the position of the message in that partition.

Consumers use offsets to know where they last read.



---

6. Producer

A client application that sends messages (writes data) to Kafka topics.

Example: An e-commerce app producing "order placed" events.



---

7. Consumer

A client application that reads messages from Kafka topics.

Example: A billing service consuming "order placed" events to generate invoices.



---

8. Consumer Group

A group of consumers that work together to read messages from a topic.

Each message is delivered to only one consumer in the group (load balancing).

Ensures scalability (multiple consumers can share the work).



---

9. Leader & Follower (Replication)

Leader: The main partition copy where all writes/reads happen.

Follower: Replicas of the partition on other brokers.

If leader fails → a follower is promoted to leader (fault tolerance).



---

10. ISR (In-Sync Replicas)

The set of replicas that are fully synchronized with the leader.

If ISR count is less than expected → risk of data loss.



---

11. ZooKeeper (legacy, being replaced by KRaft)

Previously used for cluster metadata management (brokers, topics, leaders).

Newer Kafka versions (2.8+) support KRaft mode (self-managed, no ZooKeeper).



---

12. Retention

Kafka stores messages for a configured duration (e.g., 7 days) or until a size limit is reached.

After retention, old messages are deleted (not like a queue where they vanish immediately after consumption).



---

13. Log

The actual file on disk where Kafka stores messages for a partition.

Each partition = one log file (append-only).



---

14. Lag

The difference between the last message offset in a partition and the last offset read by a consumer group.

High lag → consumer is falling behind.



---

15. Throughput

Number of messages (or bytes) produced/consumed per second.

Key metric to measure Kafka performance.



---

16. Replication Factor

Number of copies of each partition across brokers.

Higher replication = more fault tolerance, but more storage overhead.



---

17. Kafka Connect

A framework to move data between Kafka and external systems (DBs, S3, Elasticsearch, etc.).

Uses connectors (source & sink).



---

18. Kafka Streams

A library to build stream processing applications directly on Kafka.

Lets you process events in real time (filter, aggregate, join).



---

19. Schema Registry

Stores schemas (usually Avro/JSON/Protobuf) for Kafka messages.

Ensures producers and consumers agree on data format.



---

20. KSQL / ksqlDB

A SQL-like streaming query engine for Kafka.

Lets you query topics with SQL (e.g., SELECT * FROM orders_stream WHERE status='FAILED';).



---

✅ These are the core Kafka terminologies you’ll need for:

Monitoring discussions (Control Center vs Dynatrace).

Explaining Kafka in demos.

Understanding key metrics (like Lag, ISR, Throughput).

👉 Do you want me to create a visual diagram (one-pager) showing all these Kafka concepts (brokers, producers, consumers, topics, partitions, offsets, lag) so you can use it in your presentation?
Perfect 👌 you’re on the right track.

Yes — to get deep Kafka metrics in Dynatrace, you must first ensure that Kafka is exposing JMX metrics. Dynatrace Kafka extension only reads them, it doesn’t enable JMX by itself.

Here’s the step-by-step process:


---

🔹 Step 1. Enable JMX on Kafka Servers

Kafka is a Java application, and JMX is exposed via JVM system properties.

Edit the kafka-server-start.sh script (or your systemd unit if Kafka runs as a service) and set the following environment variables:

export KAFKA_OPTS="$KAFKA_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote=true \
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9999 \
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false \
  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false \
  -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=<Broker_IP_or_Hostname>"

jmxremote.port=9999 → you can change the port if 9999 is in use.

hostname → must be the IP/hostname reachable by your Dynatrace ActiveGate or OneAgent.

Restart Kafka after making the change.


⚠️ Security note: In production, avoid authenticate=false. You can configure JMX with username/password and SSL if needed.


---

🔹 Step 2. Verify JMX is Exposed

From the Kafka broker host, run:

netstat -tulnp | grep 9999

or use jconsole / jmxterm to confirm you can connect to the broker’s JMX port.


---

🔹 Step 3. Configure Dynatrace Kafka Extension

1. In Dynatrace UI, go to Dynatrace Hub → search for Kafka extension 2.0.


2. Click Set up → Add monitoring configuration.


3. Provide:

JMX host = your broker hostname

JMX port = 9999 (or what you set)

Credentials (if authentication enabled)



4. Assign the configuration to the Kafka hosts or ActiveGate.


5. Save & activate.




---

🔹 Step 4. Validate in Dynatrace

Go to Dashboards → Your Kafka dashboard.

Check if metrics like Under-replicated partitions, Active controller count, Messages in/out per topic are appearing.

If you only see JVM/infra metrics but not Kafka-specific ones → JMX is not reachable.



---

🔹 Step 5. Repeat for All Kafka Components

Kafka Brokers → JMX enabled on each broker.

Kafka Connect → run with JMX enabled.

Kafka Streams / Producers → optional, if you want JVM + producer metrics.

ZooKeeper (if not using KRaft) → also supports JMX monitoring.



---

✅ So the short answer:

First enable JMX on Kafka servers (KAFKA_OPTS).

Then configure the Kafka extension in Dynatrace Hub to connect to those JMX endpoints.



---

👉 Do you want me to give you an exact example config snippet for a systemd-based Kafka service (so you don’t have to modify scripts manually), or are you running Kafka with the default shell scripts?
