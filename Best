Here are some best practices and recommendations for AWS storage services:

General Best Practices for AWS Storage

1. Choose the Right Storage Type

Use EBS for block storage with low-latency and high-performance needs.

Use EFS for scalable and shared file storage.

Use FSx for Windows-optimized or Lustre-based workloads.

Use S3 for object storage with high durability and scalability.

Use Glacier for long-term, cost-effective archival storage.



2. Security and Encryption

Enable encryption at rest using AWS KMS-managed or customer-managed keys (CMK).

Use IAM policies and bucket policies to control access.

Enable block public access for sensitive data.

Use AWS PrivateLink or VPC endpoints for secure access without going over the internet.



3. Performance Optimization

Use provisioned IOPS for EBS when high performance is required.

Use S3 Transfer Acceleration for faster uploads.

Optimize EFS performance mode (General Purpose or Max I/O) based on workload.



4. Cost Optimization

Use S3 lifecycle policies to transition data to cheaper storage classes (e.g., from Standard to Glacier).

Delete unused snapshots in EBS to reduce costs.

Monitor storage usage with AWS Cost Explorer.



5. Backup and Disaster Recovery

Enable AWS Backup for automatic backups of EBS, EFS, FSx, and databases.

Use cross-region replication (CRR) for disaster recovery in S3.

Take regular snapshots of EBS volumes and store them in a different region.



6. Data Transfer and Migration

Use AWS Storage Gateway for hybrid cloud storage.

Use AWS Snowball or Snowmobile for large-scale data transfers.

Use AWS DataSync for efficient movement of data to the cloud.



7. Monitoring and Logging

Enable AWS CloudTrail for audit logs of storage actions.

Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor storage performance and set alerts.

Enable S3 access logging to track requests.
