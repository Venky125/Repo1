Thank you for your patience. The issue is that the aws_instance resource requires attributes such as ami, instance_type, etc., to be provided, and it cannot be used directly with an instance_id to fetch an existing EC2 instance.

We cannot use the aws_instance resource for just fetching block device mappings from an already-existing instance, which is why using it here doesn't work as intended.

Since Terraform doesn't provide direct support for querying block device mappings via the aws_instance data source, an alternative method would be to use the AWS CLI or an external data source such as external or aws_ec2_instance.

Here's the correct approach to retrieve the device names for EC2 instances using aws_instance data source and the aws_ec2_instance data source, or by fetching information via an external provider or AWS CLI calls.

Alternative Approach Using aws_instance Data Source and aws_ebs_volumes

While we cannot use the aws_instance resource for fetching device names, we can fetch volumes attached to an EC2 instance by referencing aws_ebs_volume data sources. Here's an example of how to use this approach:

Terraform Code Example:

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"  # Replace with your desired region
}

# Fetch all EC2 instance IDs
data "aws_instances" "all" {}

# Fetch EBS volumes for each instance using a data source
data "aws_ebs_volumes" "attached_volumes" {
  filter {
    name   = "attachment.instance-id"
    values = data.aws_instances.all.ids
  }
}

# Output the device names for each EC2 instance
output "instance_device_names" {
  value = [
    for instance_id in data.aws_instances.all.ids : {
      instance_id = instance_id
      device_names = [
        for volume in data.aws_ebs_volumes.attached_volumes.ids : {
          device_name = volume
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Explanation:

1. data "aws_instances" "all": This fetches all the EC2 instance IDs in the region.


2. data "aws_ebs_volumes" "attached_volumes": This data source fetches all EBS volumes attached to the instances in data.aws_instances.all.ids.


3. Output: The output contains the instance ID and its associated device names.



Key Notes:

EBS Volume Mapping: The aws_ebs_volumes data source allows you to filter volumes based on the instance-id and retrieve all attached volumes for each instance.

This approach works if you're primarily concerned with EBS volumes (which are the primary source of block storage on EC2).


AWS CLI or external Provider:

If this approach does not meet your needs and you still need to fetch specific details about EC2 block devices, the AWS CLI or an external provider can be used to execute commands that return the device names, such as aws ec2 describe-instances or aws ec2 describe-volumes.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed or if you'd like further details on using external providers!
